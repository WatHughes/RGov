## Background

The most fun thing about data science is our results and the impact we have. But for me a close second is all the new stuff to learn. There are always new-to-me data sources, algorithms, techniques, toys (er, tools), and even languages. Academic papers are important and examples from the web are great, but I learn best by doing.

One of the ways in which the world is a better place now than the world in which I grew up is the range and depth of open data. I am under the impression that most local governments are making available lots of great data, that the people making this happen are largely unappreciated, and that said data is often underutilized.

I put these two thoughts together so I plan to make a new habit. When it is time for me to learn something new I will start with some data of interest to me from a government that is local to me. Then I'll produce a data product that uses my new learning to showcase that data. This doesn't exactly give props to the people who work to make it available but hopefully they will at least be able to take pleasure in seeing good use made of their hard work.

In that spirit, I am starting with data from Richmond, VA, which is the nearest city to my home. They have made available citizen satisfaction data from 2012 and 2014. The data is geo coded, which is great because I need to be more facile with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
